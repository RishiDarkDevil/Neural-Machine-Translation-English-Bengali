        "## Introduction\n",
        "Language is the heart of communication. There are $\\sim7,100$ languages all over the world and hence communication between people belonging to two different cultures and having different languages has always been a challenge. Access to good quality translation as well as requirement has never been so high, which we observe currently. Large number of communications taking place online among people who speak different languages is eased by language technologies like automated machine translation, speech recognition and conversion to native languages, etc.\n",

        "So, as a part of The 11th Advanced Summer School on NLP (IASNLP-2022) is scheduled to be held at IIIT Hyderabad, India, whose theme revolved around Speech to Speech Machine Translation (SSMT) in Indian Languages, I have worked in developing a Neural Machine Translation Model for English to North-Eastern Language (in my case Bengali).

        "## Problem to Solve\n",
        "There is a lack of literature and good models for English to North-Eastern language machine translation. Hence, it is necessary to explore the possibility of machine translation for these languages from English. Exploration of neural architechtures is what is needed and it is important to look at the performance of these base-line models in terms of machine translation so that further research and work can be put in to train better models or improve on these models."
